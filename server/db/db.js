Never have I ever:

been kicked out of a bar
been to Australia
git rebased when I should't have
thrown my laptop at a mate
performed at the civic
poured tea on my laptop
fallen asleep during a lecture
been a member of a Glee club
done a walk of shame (aka stride of pride)
lived in a tiny house
shoplifted
been arrested
gotten stitches
gone vegan
bungy jumped
dined and dashed
jumped from a roof
had a paranormal experience
had to drink the king cup
